App Name: Nope or Dope

Concept: App is for couples. They go into the browser, type the name of the app (Nope or Dope), and get to the landing screen. There, users can make a room, and share the room id with their couple. Once the couple enter the same room, the one who is the admin (one who made the room) chooses the category. Categories will be: choose the food, food dates, realistic dates, creative dates, romantic/cringy, Goofy, Lazy... Once they have picked the category, users go to Tinder-like swipe spree. They swipe left and right (nope or dope) and once they swipe dope on the same activity, users get match screen. Once they have a match screen they can choose two options: go back to categories, or go do the activity (in which case they are going to exit the room and go to landing page). If they don't mach on non of the cards, they get a funny screen (like you are doomed screen).

The categories:
1. Choose the food - list of food (e.g. like burger, cheesburger, some type of pasta, pizza, etc.)
2. Food dates - list of food dates (e.g. cook a random recipe, fancy dinner but only with noodles, make a traditional dish from some other country, etc.)
3. Realistic dates - list of realistic dates (e.g. watch a documentary and debate it, go for a long walk, picnic, etc.)
4. Creative dates - list of creative dates (e.g. paint together, make a piece of furniture, make a song, etc.)
5. Cringy dates - list of cringey dates (e.g. go stargazing, write each other a cheesy poem, plan a fake wedding, etc.)
6. Goofy dates - list of goofy and absurd dates (e.g. wear fancy clothes and eat random food indoors, etc.)
7. Lazy dates - list of lazy dates (e.g. do absolutely nothing, binge watch something terrible, nap together, watch a movie in a genre you both hate and roast it, etc.)
There can be additional categories and lists of items under those categories
